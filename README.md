# FileManager

Update: I plan on turning this into a web service, using Django. In the process of learning how Django works, and what OS indepdent methods (e.g. Windows, "\" as the root, and on Mac, "/") I can use to search folders. 

Update 2: Upon discussion with some more experienced developers and more knowledge about web services, here's the goal:
* Outputs in JSON format, some tree - either at the root of the computer, or some specified directory.	
* In the case that I make future web services/APIs, this project can be a springboard into looking at private APIs and network security, as well as just a tool so that I can see what my server looks like.
